# TotalTerminationTournament

TotalTerminationTournament is a turn based game that originates from the core idea of Tic Tac Toe.
Unfortunately that name was well patented so I had to find an other name that can be shortened with TTT.

# Background

This API contains all basic game mechanics and Unittests for it. Unfortunately howerver I've never written an actual client for it.
So this is really just a demo and captures the game rules.
